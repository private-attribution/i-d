          High Performance Pseudorandom Secret Sharing (PRSS)
                     draft-thomson-ppm-prss-latest

Abstract

   Pseudorandom secret sharing (PRSS) enables the generation of a large
   number of shared pseudorandom values from a single shared seed.  This
   is useful in contexts where a large amount of shared randomness is
   needed, such as multi-party computation (MPC).

1.  Introduction

   A number of protocols benefit from having some means by which
   protocol entities agree on a random value.  This is particularly
   useful in multi-party computation (MPC), such as the three-party,
   honest majority setting, where many protocols rely on being able to
   generate large amounts of shared randomness.

   Pseudorandom secret sharing (PRSS) [CDI05] is a means of non-
   interactively establishing multiple shared values from a single
   shared secret.  This document describes a concrete PRSS protocol that
   can efficiently produce large quantities of shared randomness.

   This protocol is parameterized and offers algorithm agility.  This
   protocol combines a chosen key encapsulation method (KEM) and key
   derivation function (KDF) to generate shared secrets.  These shared
   secrets form the basis of a randomness context (Section 5) in which a
   chosen lightweight pseudorandom function (PRF) is used to generate
   large amounts of shared randomness.  Each randomness context can
   either be used as a sequential source of randomness Section 7.1 or as
   an indexed source Section 7.2, depending on need.

1.1.  Two-Party Protocol

   This document describes a PRSS protocol for two parties.  The set of
   KEMs defined only work in a two-party context.  If the goal is to
   create randomness that is shared with more than one entity, group key
   exchange methods, such as MLS [MLS], could be adapted as a means of
   key agreement, retaining the other elements of this protocol
   unchanged.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses the term "participant" to refer to entities that
   execute the protocol.

   Notation for KEM and KDF functions is taken from [HPKE].  e =
   I2OSP(n, i) and i = OS2IP(e) functions are taken from [RSA] and
   describe encoding and decoding non-negative integers to and from a
   byte string, respectively, using network byte order.  rev() reverses
   the order of a sequence of bytes; concat() concatenates multiple
   sequences of bytes; xor() computes the exclusive or of byte strings
   or integers of the same type; x[a..b] takes a range of bytes indexed
   from a (inclusive) to b (exclusive) from x.

3.  Overview

   A PRSS begins with the establishment of a shared secret.  This
   protocol uses a KEM to establish this value.  This is the only
   communication that occurs between participants; see Figure 1 and
   Section 4.

                          Figure 1: Key Agreement

   From this shared secret, a KDF is used to generate one or more
   randomness contexts; see Section 5.  Each randomness context can be
   used independently to produce many random values through the use of a
   PRF; see Figure 2 and Section 6.

                        Figure 2: PRSS Key Schedule

   This document describes both sequential (Section 7.1) and indexed
   (Section 7.2) access to randomness contexts, with different sampling
   methods (Section 8).

4.  Key Agreement

   The first stage of the protocol is key agreement.  In this phase,
   participants communicate and establish a shared secret.

   Protocol participants are assumed to have a means of authenticating
   each other.  A confidential communications channel is not necessary,
   though the use of TLS [TLS] for authentication purposes will also
   provide confidentiality in most cases.

   This document uses the system of describing, naming, and identifying
   KEMs defined in [HPKE].  For use in PRSS, a KEM is first chosen for
   use.  KEM identifiers from Section 7.1 of [HPKE] are used for
   identification and can be used in negotiation.

   Once a KEM is chosen, one participant is assigned the "sender" role;
   the other participant becomes the "receiver".

   The receiver commences by generating a KEM key pair as follows:

   def sk, pk_bytes = KeyGen(kem):
       sk, pk = kem.GenerateKeyPair()
       pk_bytes = kem.SerializePublicKey(pk)

   The receiver advertises their public key to the sender by
   transmitting pk_bytes.  The sender then encapsulates the KEM shared
   secret as follows:

   def ss, enc = Send(kem, pk_bytes):
       pk = kem.DeserializePublicKey(pk_bytes)
       ss, enc = kem.Encap(pk)

   The sender then sends the encapsulated secret, enc, to the receiver.
   The receiver decapsulates this value to obtain the shared secret:

   def ss = Receive(kem, sk, enc):
       ss = kem.Decap(enc, sk)

   This produces a value, ss, that is Nsecret bytes in length.

5.  Randomness Contexts

   The single shared secret that is produced by a KEM is not suitable
   for use as a source of randomness.  A key derivation function (KDF)
   is used to first extract randomness from the secret and then to
   expand it for use in different contexts.

   A randomness context is a concept that is defined by protocols that
   use PRSS.  Each context is identified by a unique string of bytes.
   This string is passed to the KDF to produce a shared value that is
   unique to that context.

   This document uses the system of describing, naming, and identifying
   KDFs defined in [HPKE].  A KDF is first chosen for use.  KDF
   identifiers from Section 7.2 of [HPKE] are used for identification
   and can be used in negotiation.

5.1.  Entropy Extraction

   A labeled method of entropy extraction is used by this document to
   ensure that the randomness provided is bound to both the chosen
   protocol parameters (KEM, KDF, and PRF) as well as the values chosen
   by participants during key agreement.

   Each participant constructs a byte sequence by concatenating the
   following sequences of bytes:

   1.  The ASCII encoding [ASCII] of the string "PRSS-00".

   2.  The identifier for the chosen KEM from Section 7.1 of [HPKE],
       encoded in two bytes in network byte order.

   3.  The identifier for the chosen KDF from Section 7.2 of [HPKE],
       encoded in two bytes in network byte order.

   4.  The identifier for the chosen PRF from Section 6, encoded in two
       bytes in network byte order.

   5.  A two byte encoding of the KEM parameter Npk in network byte
       order.

   6.  The value of pk_bytes, the public key from the receiver.

   7.  A two byte encoding of the KEM parameter Nenc in network byte
       order.

   8.  The value of enc, the key encapsulation from the sender.

   Note:  Draft versions of this protocol will be identified as "PRSS-
      00".  The suffix of this string matches the draft revision in
      which the scheme last changed.  The string will not be updated
      unless the scheme changes in an incompatible fashion.  A final
      version might either omit this suffix or include a different
      string.

   This byte sequence is provided as the ikm input to the Extract()
   function of the chosen KDF.  The shared secret, ss, is provided as
   the salt input, as follows:

   def extracted = LabeledExtract(kem, kdf, prf, ss, pk_bytes, enc):
       label = concat(
               ascii("PRSS-00"),
               I2OSP(kem.id, 2),
               I2OSP(kdf.id, 2),
               I2OSP(prf.id, 2),
               I2OSP(kem.Npk, 2),
               pk_bytes,
               I2OSP(kem.Nenc, 2),
               enc,
             )
       extracted = kdf.Extract(salt = ss, ikm = label)

   This process extracts shared entropy that is bound to this protocol
   and the context in which it was created.

5.2.  Creating Randomness Contexts

   A randomness context is identified by a byte sequence.  Applications
   that use PRSS need to describe how each randomness context it uses is
   identified.  Participants with the same shared entropy and the same
   randomness context identifier will produce the same randomness.

   A randomness context is produced by invoking the Expand() function of
   the chosen KDF, passing the shared entropy generated in Section 5.1
   as the prk input, the byte sequence that identifies the context
   (ctx_id) as the info input, and the PRF parameter Nk as the L input
   (see Section 6), as follows:

   def context = Context.new(kdf, prf, extracted, ctx_id):
       context = kdf.Expand(prk = extracted, info = ctx_id, L = prf.Nk)

   The expanded entropy produced by this process is the only information
   that is essential for a randomness context, though a real
   instantiation might also track which KEM, KDF, and PRF are used.

6.  Pseudorandom Function

   A PRF is instantiated with a secret key, k, and provides a single
   function PRF(i).

   This document adapts the PRF interface to take a non-negative integer
   as input and to produce a non-negative integer as output.  New PRF
   definitions MUST define three parameters:

   *  the size of the key (Nk),

   *  the maximum allowed value for the input (Mi), and

   *  the maximum value that can be produced as output (Mo).

   Importantly, the maximum input value SHOULD reflect a limit that is
   based on keeping attacker advantage negligible relative to an ideal
   PRF.  Any advantage needs to be bounded when an attacker is able to
   obtain output values for all input values between 0 (inclusive) and
   that maximum (exclusive).  The maximum input (Mi) is therefore likely
   to be less than the underlying function might otherwise permit.

   This assumes the usage modes from Section 7; alternative usage modes
   that pass inputs that are randomized or sparse across the entire
   input space of the underlying function are possible, but these have
   not been specified.

   Each PRF is identified by a two-byte identifier, allocated using the
   process in Section 10.

6.1.  Cached-Key AES PRF

   This document defines a PRF based on that described in [GKWY20].
   This provides a PRF that has circular correlation robustness.

   This PRF uses the AES function, either AES-128 or AES-256, as defined
   in [AES].  Both of these functions accept a 16 byte input.  The
   primary difference in these functions is the size of the key; AES-128
   uses a 16 byte key, whereas AES-256 uses a 32 byte key.  This
   information is summarized in Table 1.

             +=============+============+====+======+=======+
             | PRF Name    | Identifier | Nk |   Mi |    Mo |
             +=============+============+====+======+=======+
             | PRF_AES_128 |     0x0001 | 16 | 2^42 | 2^128 |
             +-------------+------------+----+------+-------+
             | PRF_AES_256 |     0x0002 | 32 | 2^43 | 2^128 |
             +-------------+------------+----+------+-------+

                  Table 1: Pseudorandom Function Summary

   Both AES PRFs use the same process:

   1.  The input, i, is converted to a 16-byte input using a little-
       endian encoding.

   2.  These bytes are then input to the AES function to produce a 16
       byte output.

   3.  The AES input and output are XORed produce a 16 byte sequence.

   4.  The byte sequence is interpreted as an integer using little-
       endian encoding to produce the output randomness.

   The process in pseudocode is:

   def randomness = Context.PRF(i):
       input = rev(I2OSP(i, 16))
       output = aes(k, input)
       r_bytes = xor(output, input)
       randomness = OS2IP(rev(r_bytes))

   This step is performance-sensitive, so little endian encoding is
   chosen to match the endianness of most hardware that is in use.  This
   PRF uses a constant key, which allows implementations to avoid
   computing the key expansion on each PRF invocation by caching the
   expanded values.

   Note:  A similar PRF core is described in Section 6.2.2 of [VDAF],
      based on the analysis in [GKWWY20].  The function described in
      this document operates from a limited input domain that always
      results in the high bits being zero in all cases, making the
      difference between the two approaches negligible; these approaches
      consequently only differ in the placement of the input bits.

7.  Randomness Usage Modes

   The same PRF input MUST NOT be used more than once.  Using the same
   input more than once will produce identical outputs, which might be
   exploited by an attacker.

   This section describes two basic access modes for randomness contexts
   that provide some safeguards against accidental reuse of inputs:

   *  A sequential randomness context provides access using a counter;
      see Section 7.1.

   *  An indexed randomness context provides concurrent access; see
      Section 7.2.

   These usages are incompatible; only one mode of access can be used
   for a given context.

   These usage modes are intended to use a contiguous block of input
   values, starting from 0.  The definition of the Mi parameter of the
   PRF function (see Section 6.1) assumes this usage model.

7.1.  Sequential Randomness

   In this mode, a counter, starting at zero, is retained with the
   randomness context.  Each use of the randomness context first uses
   that counter as input to the PRF, then increments it.

   def randomness = Context.next():
       randomness = Context.PRF(this.counter)
       this.counter = this.counter + 1

   This is the simplest access scheme, which is compatible with any
   sampling method; see Section 8.

7.2.  Indexed Randomness

   Indexed randomness ties the use of the randomness context to a
   sequence of application records.  The processing of each record is
   defined to each use M invocations of a certain randomness context.
   Therefore, for a given record, r, and usage, m, the context is
   invoked as context.PRF(r * M + m).  The simplest indexing scheme sets
   M to 1.

   Indexed usage is best suited to applications where individual records
   might be processed concurrently.  Using indices based on identifiers
   from an application, such as record indices, can ensure that the same
   PRF input is only used once and frees the randomness context from
   maintaining its own counter.

   Binary sampling (Section 8.2) or oversampling (Section 8.4) are best
   suited for use with indexed modes.  Rejection sampling (Section 8.3)
   is likely to be unsuitable for an indexed mode because it requires an
   unpredictable number of PRF invocations to successfully complete.

8.  Sampling from the PRF Output

   PRSS natively produces a uniformly random value in the range from 0
   (inclusive) to Mo (exclusive).

   Many applications of PRSS require the selection of a uniform random
   value from a fixed range of values.

8.1.  Available Randomness

   The total randomness available is limited by the entropy from the
   chosen KEM, KDF, and PRF.  Each KEM is only able to convey a maximum
   amount of entropy.  Similarly, each KDF is limited in the amount of
   entropy it is able to retain.  Finally, each PRF also has limits that
   might further reduce the maximum entropy available.

   Selecting values from a range that is larger than the available
   entropy will affect the uniformity of the output.  In particular,
   these methods MUST NOT be used to select from a range that has more
   values than the Mo parameter of the chosen PRF.

   If values larger than Mo are needed, the output of multiple PRF
   invocations can be combined.  With k invocations, the effective value
   of Mo increases to Mo^k.

8.2.  Binary Sampling

   If the range of desired values is a whole power of 2, then simple bit
   operations can be used to obtain a value.  For a maximum of 2^n
   (exclusive), bitwise operations can produce a value of randomness &
   ((1 << n) - 1).

   Binary sampling produces uniformly random values with the only
   drawback being the constraint on its output range.

   For small values of n, the same PRF invocation could be used to
   produce multiple values, depending on the value of Mo for the chosen
   PRF.  For large values of n, multiple invocations of the PRF can be
   used.

8.3.  Rejection Sampling

   Rejection sampling takes random values until the resulting value is
   in range.

   For values in the range 0 (inclusive) to m (exclusive), the value m
   is rounded up to the next power of 2; that is, an integer n is chosen
   such that 2^(n-1) < m <= 2^n.  Then, binary sampling (Section 8.2) is
   applied repeatedly for this larger range until the resulting value is
   less than m.

   Rejection sampling provides uniform randomness across the range from
   0 to m without bias.  However, rejection sampling can require an
   indefinite number of PRF invocations to produce a result.  Rejection
   is more likely -- and so the expected number of PRF invocations
   increases -- when m is closer to 2^(n-1) than 2^n.  This can make
   rejection sampling unsuitable for use with indexed randomness
   (Section 7.2).

   Rejection sampling might be used a limited number of times before
   falling back to oversampling (Section 8.4), which can reduce
   oversampling bias while capping the number of PRF invocations.

8.4.  Oversampling

   For a target range that is much smaller than the range of values
   produced by the PRF, reducing the PRF output modulo the maximum in
   the range can produce outputs with negligible bias.

   For example, an application might seek to produce values in the prime
   field p = 2^61 - 1.  Using the AES PRF, where Mo is 2^128, and
   reducing its output modulo p results in a bias that causes the first
   64 values of the field to be chosen with a probability of about 2^-67
   more than other values.  This degree of bias might be acceptable in
   some applications.

   To avoid excessive bias, applications SHOULD NOT use oversampling
   where the output is less than 2^48 times smaller than Mo.  The output
   of multiple PRF invocations could be combined to reduce bias.

9.  Security Considerations

   This document describes a small component of a larger system.  A
   discussion of considerations necessary to ensure correct application
   of the included techniques is provided in relevant sections.  This
   section concentrates on a more general analysis of these mechanisms.

9.1.  Usage Limit Analysis

   The usage limits in Section 6.1 ensure that attacker advantage
   remains small.  Theorem 4 of [GKWY20] models the underlying
   permutation function as an ideal PRP and shows that attacker
   advantage comprises two components:

   *  a computational limit of q²/(2*2^k) that is based solely on
      attacker work (q) and the key size (k) of the permutation

   *  a usage limit of 2pq/2^b that provides advantage proportional to
      the number of uses of the PRF (p), with the entropy of the
      pseudorandom function (b) acting to counteract attacker advantage

   The number of uses (p) are only affected by the second component, as
   the first component is unaffected by usage of the permutation.
   However, the first component guides our assumptions about the number
   of times the attacker might be willing to invoke the permutation (q).
   The result shows that statistical security is provided based on the
   birthday bound.  For instance, q being 2^64 results in a disastrous
   advantage of 0.5 for the AES-128 key size of 128 bits.  This first
   term therefore places an upper bound on the value that q can take
   before an attacker can rely solely on this computational limit.

   We use this first component to bound the value of q for the second
   component.  If advantage is equally divided between each component we
   can bound q to be at most 2^((k-a)/2), where a is the desired
   attacker advantage in bits (that is, advantage is at most 2^-a).

   Using that value for q and an advantage of (2^a)/2 for the second
   component leads to a limit for p of 2^(b-(k+a)/2-2).  For example, to
   obtain 40 bits of security, the value of p for AES-128 is limited to
   2^42, which assumes a value of q no more than 2^44.

   For AES-256, the larger key size means that the first component is
   negligible for any value of q, unless p and a are both very small.
   This is due to AES-256 having the same 128-bit block size as AES-128.
   Consequently, increasing q only reduces the value of p.

   On this basis, the same q value can be used for AES-256 as for AES-
   128.  The usage limit for AES-256 can be doubled to 2^(b-(k+a)/2-1)
   (2^43 for 40 bits of security; the first component is a negligible
   2^-169).

   This analysis models AES as an ideal pseudorandom permutation.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document establishes a new registry for "PRF Functions", under
   the grouping "PRSS".  This registry operates on a "Expert Review" for
   provisional registrations or the "Specification Required" policy for
   permanent registrations [RFC8126].  Experts for the registry are
   advised to reject registrations only when the requests are invalid,
   abusive, or duplicative of existing entries.

   New entries for the "PRF Functions" registry MUST include the
   following information:

   Name:  A short mnemonic for the PRF.
   Identifier:  An identifier from the range 0 to 65535 (inclusive).
   Nk:  The number of bytes in the PRF key.
   Mi:  The maximum value of the PRF input.
   Mo:  The maximum value of the PRF output.
   Status:  Either "permanent" or "provisional".
   Specification:  A reference to a specification for the PRF.  Citing a
      specification is optional for provisional registrations.
   Last Updated:  The date of when the registration was last updated.

   The name and identifier MUST be unique within this registry.

   No special allowance is made for private use or experimentation in
   this registry.  People conducting experiments are encouraged to
   provisionally register a codepoint so that conflicting use of the
   same identifier can be avoided.  New PRFs are encouraged to use an
   identifier that is selected at random.  IANA are advised not to
   perform allocation for identifiers, but to use the identifier that is
   provided with the registration.

   Provisional registrations MAY be removed on request.  Experts can
   approve removal after having first attempted to determine that the
   value is no longer in use and attempting to contact registrants.  Two
   months notice MUST be provided before removing a registration, even
   when the original registrant requests removal.  Any entry that are in
   standards track RFCs or that has been updated in the past 24 months
   cannot be removed.

   A request to update an entry can be made at any time; any request
   only refreshes the "Last Updated" field can be allowed automatically,
   without consulting the assigned experts.

   Starting values for the registry are shown in Table 1; these entries
   are given a "permanent" status and entries reference Section 6 of
   this document.

Appendix A.  Alternative Designs

   Where a small number of shared secrets is desired, communication can
   be a good substitute for the methods described in this document.
   Depending on the context, protocol participants can use one of a
   range of methods to agree on a random value.  This might involve the
   use of the KEM and KDF method described in Section 4, a commit-then-
   reveal protocol, or one of many alternative protocols.

   TLS exporters Section 7.5 of [TLS] are an existing example of
   pseudorandom secret sharing.  TLS exporters are suitable for small
   numbers of secrets if a TLS connection is available for use, but TLS
   exporters are an not efficient means of generating large amounts of
   randomness.

   In some applications, a TLS exporter might be used in place of the
   KEM to produce a shared secret; alternatively, the randomness context
   identifier might be provided as context to a TLS exporter so that a
   randomness context might be produced directly.

Appendix B.  Application to 2-of-3 Replicated Secret Sharing

   This section describes how PRSS might be used to produce replicated
   shares for use with replicated secret sharing MPC protocols that use
   additive or XOR secret sharing.  [CDI05] describes how to use PRSS
   for protocols that use polynomial shares.

   The simplest replicated secret sharing involves three participants
   that are arranged logically in a ring.  Each participant receives two
   of the three shares of values.  In this scheme, each participant has
   one share in common with the participant to its left and right
   respectively.

   Executing PRSS in this setting requires use of the protocol in a
   pairwise fashion; each participant executes the protocol once with
   the participant to its left and once with the participant to its
   right.  As long as participants agree on parameters - which
   randomness context is used (Section 5), which mode is used
   (Section 7), which index (if using an indexed mode; Section 7.2), and
   the sampling method (Section 8) - this produces replicated shares of
   a random value that is not known to any single participant.

   [CDI05] also describes how shares of a known, specific value might be
   produced using the same scheme, but this is more trivially
   accomplished in this setting by setting a pre-arranged share value to
   the desired value and all others to zero.
